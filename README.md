## 👨‍💻 My Role – Full Stack Developer (Admin Dashboard)

In this collaborative project, I was responsible for the end-to-end development of the **Admin Web Dashboard** as a Full Stack Developer, utilizing **Django** for the backend and managing the database via **Firebase**.

My core responsibilities included:
* **Full Stack Development:** Designing and building both the frontend interface and the backend logic for the web dashboard.
* **Database Management:** Integrating Firebase to manage and structure data for users (students, drivers) and rides in real-time.
* **System Administration:** Creating a seamless, dark-themed interface for monitoring and controlling system operations securely.
* **Clean Architecture:** Ensuring scalable, maintainable, and clean code integration with the rest of the system.

```

### Architectural Highlights
* **Monorepo Modular Structure:** Organizes the entire system components in one place.
* **Clean Code & Scalability:** Backend structured to handle data efficiently and support system growth.
* **Clear Separation of Concerns:** Distinct boundaries between the UI (Flutter apps), the Web Dashboard, and the shared Database.
